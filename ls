It looks like you're encountering issues with SSH access to GitHub. Here are the steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Check if you have an SSH key:
First, verify if you have an SSH key set up by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
ls -al ~/.ssh
This will list the SSH keys in your .ssh directory. If you see a file like id_rsa or id_ed25519, that means you already have a key. Otherwise, you will need to generate a new SSH key.

2. Generate a new SSH key (if you don't have one):
If you don't have an SSH key, you can generate one with this command:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts and set a passphrase if desired.

3. Add the SSH key to the SSH agent:
Once the key is generated, run the following commands to add it to the SSH agent:

bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
4. Add your SSH key to GitHub:
Copy your SSH public key to your clipboard:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Then, go to GitHub's SSH keys settings page, click New SSH key, paste the key, and save it.

5. Test the SSH connection:
After adding the key to GitHub, test the connection:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should get a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
6. Try pushing to the repository again:
Once the SSH key is set up and the connection is verified, try pushing your changes again:

bash
Copy code
git push origin mainlol
